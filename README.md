# Erdbook

Erdbook is an open-source Elden Ring knowledge base that attempts to cover and connect the expansive world of the Lands Between through the lore of its places and characters.

The knowledge base is built through Obsidian and the website is served with MkDocs via Github Pages.

It's still very much a work in progress and under active development.

## Motivation
This was inspired by a personal want of clarity and cohesiveness of the lore and stories from Elden Ring while unraveling character dialogues, item descriptions and events in the world.
