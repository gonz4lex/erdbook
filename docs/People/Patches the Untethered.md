First found in [[Murkwater Cave]], where he has laid a trap and tries to kill you, but will quickly surrender if attacked.

Later, he will move on to [[Liurnia of the Lakes]], where he will tell you about the Iron Virgin below the waterwheel of the [[Academy of Raya Lucaria]] and how it can transport you to [[The Erdtree]]. The device, however, will teleport you to the [[Volcano Manor]]. He can be found there later as well, where he will reveal he is a Recusant at the service of [[Lady Tanith]], proprietress of the manor.

After this, he will also ask you to carry out his own task for the Recusants by slaying his target.
