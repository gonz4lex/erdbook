Found in a chamber in the [[The Roundtable Hold]]. A deathbed companion lays with the remains of a noble after gathering life force from champions, so as to grant new life to the noble.

Fia lets you rest in her arms and grants you a Baldaquin's Blessing. She mentions Sorcerer Rogier is looking for the Black Knifeprint, and gives you a lead towards the location of the print.

Fia will also give you an engraved, gold and silver dagger, requesting you to deliver it to its rightful owner.
Upon giving the dagger to [[D, Hunter of Dead]], the next time you return to [[The Roundtable Hold]] you will find Fia in a newly opened chamber, standing over the cursed corpse of [[D, Hunter of Dead]] and she will deliver a warning message from [[Those Who Live In Death]] to the Hold, before vanishing.
