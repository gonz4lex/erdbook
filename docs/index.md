# The Erdbook

Erdbook is an open-source knowledge base for [Elden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring), a game developed by From Software and published by Bandai Namco. This book attempts to cover and connect the expansive world of the Lands Between through the lore of its places and characters.

It contains __MANY, MANY SPOILERS__ so please browse at your own risk

The knowledge base is built through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the website is served with MkDocs via Github Pages. It's still very much a work in progress and under active development.

## Motivation
This was inspired by a personal want of clarity and cohesiveness of the lore and stories from Elden Ring while unraveling character dialogues, item descriptions and events in the world.
